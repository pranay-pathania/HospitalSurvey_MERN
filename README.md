# HospitalSurvey_MERN
Another MERN App. It is a landing page (sort of) for a hospital, with a medical survey form to go along with it.
Excuse my CSS, and the fact that the site isn't responsive.

#Working
1. User enters their data
2. Upon submission, they get an alert, and get back to the main landing page
3. The user recieves a simple email from 'Magnolia Hospital' thanking them for participating in the survey

#Concepts learnt on the go
1. Nodemailer (of course)
2. Handling inputs from radio buttons and checkboxes
3. React Router

#Note to self
When sending an email, go to myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and toggle.
